# My-JavaScript-Password-Generator


# Module 3 Challenge - Password Generator
-03 JavaScipt Password Generator

## Description
- In this challenge I used JavaScript to make a random generated password.
- I used a function to generate my password
- I used if window.comand to get my prompts.

- In the future of this particular project I realize that I am getting the correct number of characters
but it is always choosing from all four arrays.  I want to fix this.
